# Turing-Machine

It's the base of all things to do with pattern matching and compilers in general.
A Turing Machine works using a tape of infinite length and a tapehead that can read and write onto the tape.
It can be used to perform almost all basic operations such as unary addition, unary subtraction, 1s complements, 2s complements etc.
